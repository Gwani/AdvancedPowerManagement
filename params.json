This mod adds several new blocks to Industrial Craft 2 to help you\r\nmanage your energy grid. The scope of the mod has expanded since the original\r\nversion, and it is no longer named for the single block it originally added. You\r\nwill now find contained herein for your crafting enjoyment the following high\r\nquality devices: The Charging Bench, the Battery Station, and the Storage\r\nMonitor (plus the Adjustable Emitter for creative play).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new and improved IC2 Charging Bench!\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe charging bench allows you to charge up to 12 items simultaneously! It comes\r\nin three tiers with each tier capable of charging all items at its tier level\r\nand below, but not above. If you want to charge your Quantum armor you'll need\r\nto craft a HV version - there's no getting around the need for that specialized\r\nhigh-power equipment, sadly. :)\r\n\r\nLV Charging Bench\r\n- The low voltage charging bench has a maximum input energy of 32 EU/t, and a\r\n  base energy storage of 40,000 EU.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 Batbox\r\n  3 Insulated Copper Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nMV Charging Bench\r\n- The medium voltage charging bench has a maximum input energy of 128 EU/t, and\r\n  a base energy storage of 600,000 EU.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 MFE\r\n  3 2x Insulated Gold Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nHV Charging Bench\r\n- The high voltage charging bench has a maximum input energy of 512 EU/t, and a\r\n  base energy storage of 10,000,000 EU.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 MFSU\r\n  3 4x Insulated HV (Iron) Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nCrafting pattern for all charging benches:\r\n  CCC   C = Cable, W = Wood,\r\n  WEW   E = Electronic Circuit,\r\n  WSW   S = Storage Unit (Batbox, etc)\r\n\r\nFeatures common to all Charging Benches\r\n-------------------\r\nDue to advances in over-current circuit protection designs, a Charging Bench\r\nwill not explode if exposed to higher than acceptable current but simply pop off\r\nonto the ground in a safe manner, ejecting any items it contained.\r\n\r\nA charging bench will automatically direct valid electrical items shift-clicked\r\nfrom your inventory into the charging area if there is space free. Excess will\r\nbe placed into the input slot. Once an item is done charging, it will be\r\nautomatically moved to the output slot, if there is space, and another item from\r\nthe input slot will be added to the main charging area. In this way, you can\r\nshift-click a full stack of RE-Batteries into the Charging Bench, and it will\r\nautomatically unstack and charge them. You can quickly and easily collect all of\r\nthem by shift-clicking repeatedly on the output slot.\r\n\r\nWhile using a charging bench, you will have easy access to your equipped armor\r\nslots. If you are wearing electrical armor, you can shift-click it directly from\r\nyour armor slots into the bench. When it's done charging, simply shift-click it\r\nfrom the output slot (or the charging area, if you've let some other item loiter\r\nin the output slot) and it will automatically equip the armor in the correct\r\nlocation. It doesn't get much easier than that!\r\n\r\nAnd we're not done yet with the awesome features of this mod! Each charging\r\nbench now includes a pair of indicators visible right on the outside of the\r\nbench. The storage meter lets you see just how much power is available for\r\ncharging up your items, and the charging light lets you know if those energy-\r\nhungry items are done charging without even opening the GUI. You can toss in\r\nyour quantum armor, lapotron crystals, mining laser, etc, and walk away, and\r\nwith merely a glance across the room, you'll know when they're ready to be\r\npicked up! Even the battery slot is wired up, so that if you're filling a remote\r\nbench using items, you'll know when it's time to swap out the battery without\r\nhaving to stand around waiting for it to discharge completely.\r\n\r\nAvailable upgrades!\r\n-------------------\r\nAll three tiers of the Charging Bench accept the standard array of upgrades,\r\nwith each having a very specific effect.\r\n\r\n- The transformer upgrade will allow the lower tier benches to accept higher\r\n  input energy, including energy crystals, lappacks, and lapotrons in the power\r\n  input slot.\r\n\r\n- The energy storage upgrade will increase the maximum energy storage of the\r\n  device. The LV bench now gains 10,000 EU per upgrade, the same amount the\r\n  battery used to craft the upgrade would be able to store. The MV bench gains\r\n  60,000 EU or 10% of its base storage capacity for each upgrade installed. And\r\n  the HV bench gains a whopping 500,000 EU capacity per upgrade!\r\n\r\n- The overclocker upgrade lets you push your Charging Bench to the limit. By\r\n  using quantum tunneling technology, the Charging Bench is able to carefully\r\n  manage the voltage and current levels used to charge items and allow items to\r\n  safely exceed their normal charge rates. This unfortunately has the same\r\n  drawback that always accompanies the use of overclockers: The amount of power\r\n  consumed increases even as the time required to charge an item decreases.\r\n  Specifically, each upgrade increases the amount of energy transferred to an\r\n  item per tick by 30% and the amount of energy drained from the bench's\r\n  internal storage by 50%, growing exponentially with every overclocker added.\r\n  Since it's hard to do that kind of math in your head, here's an example: Five\r\n  overclockers approximately doubles the energy used to charge any given item,\r\n  but the time required to charge it is reduced by nearly 75%!\r\n\r\n  For those interested, the formulas for some useful values are:\r\n    Speed:           S = (1.3^x)\r\n    Time required:   T = 1/S\r\n    Energy consumed: E = (1.5^x)/S\r\n  where x is the number of overclockers. (Just multiply the normal values by S,\r\n  T, or E.)\r\n\r\nThere's more!!\r\n-------------------\r\nThe Charging Bench's input, output and power slots are exposed to pipes, tubes,\r\nand other devices. Input is on top, output is on bottom and the power slot is\r\nfrom all sides. While the GUI restricts items placed into each of the slots to\r\nappropriate types there is no such restriction for pipe/tube access. It is up to\r\nthe player to design their systems so that the wrong types of items don't get\r\ntossed onto the bench. But not to worry, there are no negative consequences to\r\ninserting incorrect items, aside from temporarily clogging up the slot; the\r\nbench simply will not do anything with items that it can't process.\r\n\r\nValid electrical items placed into the charging bench via tubes will\r\nautomatically be moved from the input slot to an available charging slot, then\r\nmoved to the output slot once fully charged. In this way, you can easily\r\nautomate recharging of items!\r\n\r\nModular construction with easy assembly and disassembly!\r\n-------------------\r\nUsing a simple toolkit and a charging bench in your crafting window, you can\r\ndisassemble it into its components, which you can then use to upgrade an\r\nalready-placed charging bench simply by right-clicking on the bench using the\r\ncomponents. (You can also downgrade a bench, should you wish, but use caution\r\nregarding the voltage of any attached cables if you do.) You will receive a\r\ncomponent kit for the bench you replaced, and can just as easily reassemble the\r\ncomponents into a complete bench, ready to be placed. This means that you'll\r\nnever lose a bench through this process! Additionally, if you no longer have any\r\nneed for a bench, you can strip the components to scavenge the useful parts from\r\nthem by right-clicking while holding sneak (as a safety measure), but be warned\r\nthat the wood planks are not returned - they're custom cut for the shape of the\r\nbench, after all, and the scavenging process often requires breaking them up to\r\nremove more delicate parts. (Plus there's no way to know what kind of wood was\r\nused.)\r\n\r\nThe toolkit required to convert a charging bench into a component kit and vice\r\nversa is very simple, requiring only one iron ingot and two sticks in the\r\nfollowing pattern to craft:\r\n\r\n   I\r\n  S S\r\n\r\n\r\nBattery Station\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSure, a charging bench lets you fill up a lot of items at the same time with\r\nease, but what if you want to do the opposite and drain power from a lot of\r\nitems? That's what the brand new Battery Station allows you to do!\r\n\r\nThe battery station comes in the same three tiers as the charging bench, but\r\nwhere the bench is crafted with an energy storage unit, the battery station\r\nrequires a transformer instead.\r\n\r\nLV Battery Station\r\n- The low voltage battery station outputs energy in 32 EU packets, and can drain\r\n  RE-batteries and other tier 1 power source items like the batpack.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 LV-Transformer\r\n  3 Insulated Copper Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nMV Battery Station\r\n- The medium voltage battery station outputs energy in 128 EU packets, and can\r\n  drain energy crystals and other tier 2 power source items like the lappack,\r\n  plus tier 1 power sources.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 MV-Transformer\r\n  3 2x Insulated Gold Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nHV Battery Station\r\n- The high voltage battery station outputs energy in 512 EU packets, and can\r\n  drain lapotron crystals and other tier 3 power source items, as well as all\r\n  lower tier power sources.\r\n\r\n- Crafting recipe:\r\n  1 HV-Transformer\r\n  3 4x Insulated HV (Iron) Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nCrafting pattern for all battery stations:\r\n  CCC   C = Cable, W = Wood,\r\n  WEW   E = Electronic Circuit,\r\n  WTW   T = Transformer\r\n\r\nFeatures of the Battery Station\r\n-------------------\r\nEach battery station will output one packet of energy every tick, if it's able\r\nto drain enough EU from the items in its inventory. Remember that different\r\nenergy storage items have different transfer rates, so a single battery in a HV\r\nBattery Station will not allow it to provide power every tick. It will take\r\nmultiple ticks for the station to drain sufficient EU from one battery into its\r\nbuffer.\r\n\r\nTo avoid potential problems with excessive energy loss over cabling, a battery\r\nstation will never transmit a packet of EU less than its rated output. Instead\r\nit carries over the buffered EU from one tick to the next until it has enough EU\r\nstored to output a full packet.\r\n\r\nA battery station can drain multiple items at once, if it doesn't get enough\r\nenergy from the first item to be able to emit EU (but it will only drain the\r\nminimum number of items needed for it to be able to send one packet per tick).\r\nThis allows a MV (or HV) battery station to run at maximum efficiency even if\r\nsupplied only with charged RE-batteries (and/or energy crystals) instead of the\r\nmore expensive lapotron crystals.\r\n\r\nThe battery station supports automation features much like the charging bench!\r\nIt will move full batteries, crystals, or other storage devices from its input\r\nslot to its discharging area, and empty items to its output slot. When an item\r\nis removed from the discharging area the other items present will be advanced\r\nautomatically, so that newly added items will not 'cut in line'. That is to say,\r\nthe battery station operates in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner, as long as\r\nyou don't rearrange items within its inventory manually, of course. ;) Like the\r\ncharging bench, you can use pipes, tubes, machines, or other methods to\r\nautomatically add and remove electrical items capable of being used as a power\r\nsource. In concert with a charging bench, you can even create systems to\r\nautomatically transport EU from one location to another, storing it in items to\r\navoid the inefficiency and material expense of long cable runs.\r\n\r\nThe input slot is accessed from the top or bottom of a battery station, and the\r\noutput slot is accessed from any side. Note that this layout is different from\r\nthe charging bench, because the battery station only has two slots that need to\r\nbe accessible. Cabling to accept the EU output from the battery station may be\r\nattached to any face (top, bottom, or sides), or the station may be placed\r\ndirectly adjacent to the machines you want it to power.\r\n\r\nFinally, the battery station has two more features similar to those of the\r\ncharging bench. One is an activity indicator light, which will be lit while it\r\nis draining items or sending out EU. The other is that a redstone signal will\r\ndeactivate the battery station, preventing it from performing any actions at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage Monitor\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nEveryone who's tried to set up an energy monitoring system of some sort knows\r\nthat the redstone signals from your batbox, MFE, or MFSU are very challenging to\r\nmake use of in an effective manner - not to mention the fact that if you have a\r\nlot of wiring connected to the storage unit, it can be very tricky to get a\r\nredstone signal out of it, too, especially using vanilla redstone mechanics!\r\nFret no more, because the storage monitor allows you to remotely monitor an\r\nenergy storage unit in an easy and user-friendly way. It will start emitting\r\nredstone when the power level falls below a certain threshold, and stop when the\r\npower rises above another threshold.\r\n\r\nBut that's not all! It allows you to easily configure the thresholds at which\r\nthe redstone signal turns on and off, so that you can customize its behavior to\r\nyour precise needs. Hook it up to activate your nuclear reactor only when your\r\nMFSU's power is below 10%, so that renewable sources of energy will be used to\r\nrefill your power reserves as often as possible... or make certain your high\r\npower consumption factory floor never runs out of juice by activating it any\r\ntime the power falls below 80 or 90%!\r\n\r\nJust craft a link card and connect it to the device you wish to monitor by\r\nright-clicking on the batbox, MFE, or MFSU with the card. You can even monitor a\r\ncharging bench, or other mods' EU storage blocks, if they implement the\r\nIEnergyStorage interface from the IC2 API! Once you have encoded the card with\r\nthe storage unit's unique ID and location, insert the card into the Storage\r\nMonitor and use the controls to configure its behavior. Or you can just keep the\r\ndefault settings, and the redstone signal will turn on when power falls below\r\n60% and shut off when it rises to 90%.\r\n\r\nIf you need to move your energy storage unit or want to reuse a link card\r\nelsewhere, there's no need to throw it away and craft a new one. You can wipe a\r\nlink card clean by holding it in your hand and right-clicking in the air while\r\nholding your sneak key (as a safety feature to prevent accidental erasure). It\r\nwill revert to a blank link card creator which you can then reuse on any storage\r\nunit you'd like.\r\n\r\nCrafting recipes\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nStorage monitor\r\n  1 Gold Cable (No insulation)\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  1 Redstone Dust\r\n  2 Glass\r\n  4 Wooden Planks\r\n\r\nPattern:\r\n  WUW   U = Uninsulated Gold Cable,\r\n  GEG   W = Wood, E = Electronic Circuit,\r\n  WRW   G = Glass, R = Redstone Dust\r\n\r\nLink Card Creator\r\n  1 Insulated Copper Cable\r\n  1 Electronic Circuit\r\n  1 Paper\r\n\r\nPattern:\r\n  C     C = Cable,\r\n   E    E = Electronic Circuit,\r\n    P   P = Paper\r\n\r\n\r\nEmitters? What's this?\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nOriginally created for testing purposes, we have added these Emitter blocks to\r\nthe creative inventory as a bonus for people playing in creative mode or wanting\r\nto test electrical builds without having to constantly spawn lapotron crystals\r\nand MFSUs.\r\n\r\nThere are five versions available. They have no crafting recipes, and must be\r\nacquired from the creative inventory or via tools like NEI.\r\n\r\nLV Emitter\r\n-  Emits LV current (32 EU/t) when powered by redstone\r\n\r\nMV Emitter\r\n-  Emits MV current (128 EU/t) when powered by redstone\r\n\r\nHV Emitter\r\n-  Emits HV current (512 EU/t) when powered by redstone\r\n\r\nEV Emitter\r\n-  Emits EV current (2048 EU/t) when powered by redstone\r\n\r\nAdjustable Emitter\r\n-  Emits a custom amount of energy when powered by redstone.\r\n-  Comes with a GUI that allows you to configure the amount of energy per packet\r\n   and the rate of energy generation. Packet size can range from 4 to 8192 EU\r\n   (in case you have cables that can carry more than 2048) and EU generation\r\n   rate can range from 1 EU per tick to 65536 EU/t, but has an additional cap of\r\n   64 packets per tick to prevent excessive server lag. If packet size is\r\n   greater than EU generation then a packet will not be emitted on every tick.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------------------\r\nOriginal idea: Drashian\r\nOriginal Charging Bench graphics: Starlight\r\nBattery Station textures: Tallinu\r\nEmitter and Storage Monitor textures: Pantheis\r\nCharging Bench and Battery Station GUIs: Tallinu\r\nStorage Monitor and Adjustable Emitter GUIs: Pantheis and Tallinu\r\nCharging Bench toolkit and upgrade item textures: Tallinu\r\nStorage Monitor link card item textures: Pantheis\r\nCode: Pantheis and Tallinu\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the original Charging Bench mod.
