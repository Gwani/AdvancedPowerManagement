Introducing the completely new Industrial Craft 2 Charging Bench!

This mod adds a Charging Bench to Industrial Craft 2 which allows you to charge up to 12
items simultaneously! The Charging Bench comes in three tiers with each tier capable of
charging all items at its tier level and below, but not above. If you want to charge your
Quantum armor you'll need to craft a HV version. :)


Introducing the three tiers of Charging Bench available!
-------------------
Due to advances in over-current circuit protection designs, the Charging Bench will not
explode if exposed to higher than acceptable current but simply pop off onto the ground in a
safe manner.

LV Charging Bench
- The LV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 32 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 40,000 EU.

MV Charging Bench
- The MV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 128 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 600,000 EU.

HV Charging Bench
- The HV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 512 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 10,000,000 EU.

A charging bench will automatically place valid electrical items shift-clicked into
it into the charging area if there is space free. Excess will be placed into the input slot.
Once an item is done charging, it will be automatically moved to the output slot, if there is
space, and another item from the input slot will be added to the main charging inventory.

In this way, you can shift-click a full stack of RE-Batteries into the Charging Bench, it will
automatically unstack them, charge them and you can quickly collect them just by shift-clicking
repeatedly on the output slot.

A charging bench also includes direct access to your player's armor slots. If you're wearing
electrical based armor, you can shift-click it directly from your armor slots into the bench.
When it's done charging, simply shift-click it from the output slot and it will automatically
equip it into the correct location. It doesn't get much easier than that!

And we're not done yet with the awesome features of this mod! Each charging bench now includes
a "battery meter" on every side of the bench. You can see how much power you have available
without even opening the GUI.


Available upgrades!
-------------------
All three tiers of the Charging Bench accept the standard array of upgrades, with each having
a very specific effect.

- The transformer upgrade will allow the lower tier benches to accept higher input energy,
  including energy crystals, lappacks, and lapotrons in the power input slot.

- The energy storage upgrade will increase the maximum energy storage of the device. The LV
  bench now gains 10,000 EU per upgrade, the same amount the battery used to craft the upgrade
  would be able to store. The MV bench gains 60,000 EU or 10% of its base storage capacity for
  each upgrade installed. And the HV bench gains a whopping 500,000 EU capacity per upgrade!

- The overclocker upgrade lets you push your Charging Bench to the limit. By using quantum
  tunneling technology, the Charging Bench is able to carefully manage the voltage and current
  levels used to charge items and allow items to safely exceed their normal charge rates. This
  unfortunately has the same drawback that always accompanies the use of overclockers: The
  amount of power consumed increases even as the time required to charge an item decreases.
  Specifically, each upgrade increases the amount of energy transferred to an item per tick by
  30% and the amount of energy drained from the bench's internal storage by 50%, growing
  exponentially with every overclocker added. Since it's hard to do that kind of math in your
  head, here's an example: Five overclockers approximately doubles the energy used to charge
  any given item, but the time required to charge it is reduced by nearly 75%!

  For those interested, the formulas for some useful values are:
    Speed:           S = (1.3^x)
    Time required:   T = 1/S
    Energy consumed: E = (1.5^x)/S
  where x is the number of overclockers. (Just multiply the normal values by S, T, or E.)

There's more!!
-------------------
The Charging Bench's input, output and power slots are exposed to pipes, tubes, and other
devices. Input is on top, output is on bottom and the power slot is from all sides. While the
GUI restricts items placed into each of the slots to appropriate types there is no such
restriction for pipe/tube access. It is up to the player to design their systems so that the
wrong types of items don't get tossed onto the bench. But not to worry, there are no negative
consequences to inserting incorrect items, aside from temporarily clogging up the slot; the
bench simply will not do anything with items that it can't process.

Valid electrical items placed into the charging bench via tubes will automatically be moved
from the input slot to an available charging slot, then moved to the output slot once fully
charged. In this way, you can easily automate recharging of items!


Emitters? Wha?
-------------------
Originally created for testing purposes, we have added these Emitter blocks to the creative
inventory as a bonus for people playing in creative mode or wanting to test electrical builds
without having to constantly spawn lapotron crystals and MFSUs. 

There are four versions available.

LV Emitter
-  Emits LV current (32 EU/t) when powered by redstone

MV Emitter
-  Emits MV current (128 EU/t) when powered by redstone

HV Emitter
-  Emits HV current (512 EU/t) when powered by redstone

EV Emitter
-  Emits EV current (2048 EU/t) when powered by redstone
